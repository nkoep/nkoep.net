My name is Niklas, and I am currently based out of Berlin where I work as a
data scientist in the logistics department at Delivery Hero.
In my role I mainly deal with predictive modeling around the topic of optimal
courier staffing throughout the day.
Before moving to Berlin, I studied electrical engineering at RWTH Aachen
University where I graduated with an M.Sc. in 2014, and a doctoral degree in
2019.

### Pymanopt

[Pymanopt](https://www.pymanopt.org) is a Python toolbox for numerical
optimization on Riemannian manifolds with support for automatic
differentiation.
Riemannian structures frequently arise in the context of signal processing and
machine learning where constraint sets often form a smooth nonlinear search
space.
To attack such problems, Pymanopt, which is based on the MATLAB toolbox
[Manopt](https://www.manopt.org/), provides a variety of different solvers
(e.g. steepest descent, conjugate gradients, trust-regions), manifolds (e.g.
Stiefel manifold, Grassmannian, positive definite matrices) and
autodiff backends (currently [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and
[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
By appealing to automatic differentiation, the toolbox lowers the entry barrier
for rapid prototyping as the need for laborious calculation of higher-order
derivatives of matrix expressions by hand is removed.

### Lampions

[Lampions](https://github.com/lampions) is an email relaying service leveraging
AWS SES to forward incoming emails on a verified domain to pre-configured
forwarding addresses.
The goal is to insulate a user's primary email address(es) from third-party
services by providing an easy and convenient way to create per-service
forwarding addresses.
The project consists of a command-line utility to configure the necessary AWS
infrastructure and define email routes.
Additionally, a browser extension can be used to define, remove or temporarily
deactivate email aliases in case one wants to stop receiving emails for certain
aliases.

## Video Editing

During my teenage years, my creative outlet was editing frag movies about the
competitive scene of the game Counter-Strike.
I eventually retired the hobby in 2008 after enrolling in university but picked
it up again for a while in late 2015.
Some selected works dating back all the way to 2007 can be found below.
