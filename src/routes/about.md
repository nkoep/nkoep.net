### Pymanopt

[Pymanopt](https://www.pymanopt.org) is a Python toolbox for numerical
optimization on Riemannian manifolds with support for automatic
differentiation.
Riemannian structures frequently arise in the context of signal processing and
machine learning where constraint sets often form a smooth nonlinear search
space.
To attack such problems, Pymanopt, which is based on the MATLAB toolbox
[Manopt](https://www.manopt.org/), provides a variety of different solvers
(e.g., steepest descent, conjugate gradients, trust-regions), manifolds (e.g.,
Stiefel manifold, Grassmannian, positive definite matrices) and
autodiff backends (currently [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/),
[Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) and
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)).
By appealing to automatic differentiation, the toolbox lowers the entry barrier
for rapid prototyping as laborious calculations of higher-order derivates by
hand are eliminated.
