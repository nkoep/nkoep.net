In this place I collect various quotes from books, movies and songs that spoke
to me in one way or another for reasons I try not to think about too much.

### Norma Jean - Disconnecktie: The Faithful Vampire

> And at the very root of me I know this; it's the greatest reminder. What a
> broad world to roam in, what a sea to swim in. So I begin with the end in
> mind.

### Wes Anderson - The French Dispatch

> Maybe with good luck, we'll find what eluded us in the places we once called
> home.

### James Joyce - A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

> Mother indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have read too much. Not true.
> Have read little and understood less.

### George Eliot - Middlemarch

> ...for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts;
> and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is
> half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in
> unvisited tombs.

### Gore Vidal - The City and the Pillar

> There had been a yesterday and a day before, and twenty-five years of being
> alive before he found the bar.

> He was happy to get up in the morning; he was happy to go to bed at night
> with the thought of a new day to look forward to. He knew his life was
> aimless, and he could not have been more content.

> He would suffer. He would know pain. With infinite care and patience, he set
> about destroying his own happiness.

### Albert Camus - The Fall

> As people commonly say, I loved women---which amounts to saying that I never
> loved any one of them.

### Henry Miller - Tropic of Cancer

> I sit down beside her and she talks---a flood of talk. Wild consumptive notes
> of hysteria, perversion, leprosy. I hear not a word because she is beautiful
> and I love her and now I am happy and willing to die.

### Jack Kerouac - On the Road

> [...] the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live,
> mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the
> ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like
> fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in
> the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes "Awww!"

> I like too many things and get all confused and hung-up running from one
> falling star to another till I drop. This is the night, what it does to you.
> I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion.

> A pain stabbed my heart, as it did every time I saw a girl I loved who was
> going the opposite direction in this too-big world.
