## Video Editing

As a teenager, I heavily got into frag movie editing.
While I never played the game myself, my game of choice was Counter-Strike 1.6.
I got so obsessed with the hobby that for a while I would start work on the
next project the day after I had finished the current one.
I eventually retired the hobby when I went to university in 2008, but I got
pulled back into it in 2015 when my friends [Anthony
Perfetto](https://twitter.com/ANPerfetto) and [Daniel
Hagelin](https://twitter.com/danielhagelin) got in touch after picking up
editing again, this time for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

### Echoes of 2017

*Echoes of 2017* was the culmination of several months of work and is the
work I am most satisfied with as a whole.
Unlike in the previous iteration, [Echoes of
2016](https://youtu.be/MO_XwBLHsFE) (which features the most
[satisfying](https://youtu.be/MO_XwBLHsFE?t=178) AV synchronization I ever
pulled off), where I took the reins, this time I
[closed](https://youtu.be/DtJYa5F2ghI?t=458) out the video.
